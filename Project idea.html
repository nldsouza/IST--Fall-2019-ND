<body> The website that I plan on developing will be a video streaming service called Film Junction which will contain the content of independent films. The website will contain around five to six pages which will be a home page, browse content page, application for submission page, a contact us page, and a subscription page. The home page will be set up as a blog, regarding topics and discussions on films that have been featured on the website. Personally, as a film major I have had this idea to create a streaming service for around two years now and the purpose of this website is to build a platform for independent filmmakers. I plan on getting my content from current students and frineds that have completed films that they would want people to see, in order to kickstart their carreers.
